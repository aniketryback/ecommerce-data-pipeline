README.md — E-Commerce Data Pipeline using Airflow and AWS
**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Data Engineering pipeline for an e-commerce use case, built using Apache Airflow, Python, and AWS services.

The goal is to simulate a real-world ETL pipeline — ingesting, transforming, and storing e-commerce order data in the cloud for downstream analytics.

Architecture
Local Landing Zone → Airflow DAG → S3 Raw Zone → Transformation → S3 Processed Zone → Ready for Analysis


Workflow Steps:

Ingestion – CSV files are picked up from the local landing_zone and uploaded to an AWS S3 raw bucket.

Transformation – The raw data is cleaned, transformed, and uploaded to a processed bucket.

Orchestration – All steps are automated and monitored using Apache Airflow DAGs.

Logging – Each step maintains logs for traceability and debugging.

**Tech Stack**
Component	Technology
Orchestration	Apache Airflow
Programming	Python
Cloud Storage	AWS S3
Logging	Python Logging

**Airflow DAG Flow**

Task Sequence:

extract_orders → Uploads local CSVs to S3 raw zone.

transform_orders → Cleans and formats the raw data.

load_processed → Uploads transformed files to processed zone.

Each task runs in sequence within the same DAG (ecommerce_dag).

**Key Features**

✅ Incremental ingestion — loads only 10% of new data per run.

✅ Cloud integration using boto3 and AWS S3.

✅ Automated orchestration via Airflow.

✅ Logging and error tracking for debugging.

✅ Modular Python scripts for each stage.

Learning Outcomes

Building end-to-end ETL pipelines.

Implementing Airflow DAGs with Python operators.

Automating data uploads to AWS S3.

Handling partial/incremental ingestion logic.

Setting up logging and debugging pipelines.

🧰 Setup Instructions
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ecommerce-data-pipeline.git
cd ecommerce-data-pipeline

2️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Start Airflow
airflow standalone

4️⃣ Access Airflow UI

Visit: http://localhost:8080

Login with:

user: admin
password: admin

5️⃣ Run the DAG

Trigger the DAG ecommerce_dag manually from the Airflow UI or let it run on schedule.

🧾 Future Enhancements

Add AWS Lambda for event-driven ingestion.
